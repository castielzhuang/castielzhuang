- 👋 Hi, I’m Castiel Chen Zhuang
- 👀 I’m interested in development economics, especially the (economic, social, and environmental) determinants of health, human capital development, and poverty alleviation.
- 🌱 I aim to become a development economist who applies analytical tools from public health, labor economics, and industrial organization (such as RCT, applied econometrics, and structural estimation).
- 💞️ I have been an Assistant Professor of Development Economics in the School of Economics at Peking University (since August 2022).
