- 👋 Hi, I’m @castielzhuang
- 👀 I’m interested in topics related to healthcare systems and policies, firms' and households' human capital investment decisions (e.g., education and on-the-job training), precarious employment, and poverty alleviation (e.g., temporary basic income).
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to become a development economist who applies analytical tools from public health, labor economics, and industrial organization (such as RCT, applied econometrics, and structural estimation).
- 💞️ I will be on the 2021-2022 job market. I am open to all research-oriented job opportunities, including assistant professor, postdoctoral scholar, and research fellow.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by email: cczhuang@uw.edu; zogcee@gmail.com
